<!--OVERVIEW-->
This extremely powerful report allows you to drill down through every page viewed within every session undertaken by your authenticated site users. It can be particularly useful in assessing the behavioral trends of these key visitors, and can help in the planning of new site content. This report can also assist in the enforcement of acceptable use policies in an Intranet environment (allowing administrators to hone in on individual authenticated employees of an organization).
