# Report: World Regions
# Please see Languages\English\Help Cards\Readme.txt for instructions.

<!--OVERVIEW-->
This report shows the most popular world regions in which your site visitors are located.

Knowing where large groups of visitors originate may help to tailor your site content and/or structure to better serve these majorities.  If visitors from particular world regions are of interest to your organization, yet only represent a small amount of overall traffic, it may highlight a need to more effectively advertise and promote your site to these regions.

Note: All machines on the Internet have a unique IP address (192.77.210.55) associated with them.  Several machines also have named addresses (www.quest.com) against their IP addresses for ease of use.  Many machines do NOT have a name associated with them, and these display as [UNRESOLVED IP] in this report.

If the only entry in this report is [UNRESOLVED IP], then you need to enable DNS Lookups, in <i>Settings > Analysis > Network > DNS</i>.

<!--GRAPH-->
The graph shows different world regions and their associated level of traffic. The colors on the map correspond to the different levels of traffic in the key to the left of the graph.
