<!--OVERVIEW-->
This report shows whether or not the servers in your clustered environment are performing as expected. The bars on the graph should be as similar as possible. If there are major differences, there may be a problem with your load balancer. If certain servers have a higher amount of errors, maintenance work may be necessary.
