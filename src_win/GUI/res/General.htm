			<p ALIGN="center"><b><FONT SIZE="3">Report</p>
			<p></FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2">This application&nbsp;provides a number of general 
					settings for processing Web log files. These include ana</FONT>lysis 
				between a range of dates, filtering out zero byte files, DNS lookups, to 
				resolve IP addresses and different levels of sorting. The various settings are 
				described below.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p ALIGN="center"><IMG SRC="pref_report.JPG"></p>
			<p></p>
			<p><b>Dates</p>
			<p></p>
			<p></B>It is often useful to process log files on a month to month basis and make 
				these statistics available on your Web site. However, most Web servers require 
				the server to be stopped for the log file to be collected and processed. It is 
				therefore difficult to ensure that a log file spans each month exactly (unless 
				you have an automated procedure available). To ensure your your log statistics 
				span an entire month&nbsp;we allow you to specify a range of dates to process. 
				The default is to process all dates.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>To specify a range of dates select "All dates" within the range box. You may now 
				enter a start and end date to process. These dates are inclusive, so that log 
				files will be processed on and between the dates specified.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The date format used is determined from the settings in the Regional Settings 
				control panel.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p><b>DNS lookups</p>
			<p></p>
			<p></B>The DNS lookup feature allows you to resolve IP addresses into domain names 
				during the analysis procedure. So an IP address such as 128.250.196.5 will 
				return an appropriate domain name such as "www.mycomp.com", necessary for some 
				of the statistical procedures. Note however that this feature significantly 
				slows down log file processing and is normally not required for most log files.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>This feature should be switched on for servers which do not automatically 
				resolve IP addresses into domain names. Some servers have this feature switched 
				off to increase server perfomance.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p><b>Filtering zero byte files</p>
			<p></p>
			<p></B>Turn this option on to remove zero length files (links to other locations) 
				from the final report to give a more accurate representation of actual files 
				served.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p><b>Ignore Self Referals</p>
			<p></p>
			<p></B>This will ignore all referals to your own site so you only get external 
				referals in your list.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p><b>Sorting</p>
			<p></p>
			<p></B>Once the log file has been processed the report tables may be sorted by 
				Name, Requests or Bytes sent. By default sorting is automatically performed on 
				the name of the report statistic, such as the Country, Browser type, Operating 
				System etc. This also affects the charting procedures. Note however that no 
				sorting is performed on the Daily, Weekly or Hourly Statistics.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p></p>
			<p ALIGN="center"><b><FONT SIZE="4">Report - Output</p>
			<p ALIGN="center"></p>
			<p></FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2"><IMG SRC="pref_report2.JPG"></p>
			<p></p>
			<p></FONT><b>Output file</p>
			<p></p>
			<p></B>This option allows you to specify the name and location of the output file. 
				Clicking this button brings up the standard save file dialog to specify the 
				output name and location.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p><b>URL</p>
			<p></p>
			<p></B>A number of reports produced&nbsp;provide hypertext links back to the 
				original location of the file, which is important for review purposes, 
				particularly when you need to refer back to the page in question. To produce 
				viable links when your reports are not served from the same web site it is 
				important to provide&nbsp;the Base URL of your web site. So, if the log file 
				you are processing comes from "http://www.company.com", this is what you will 
				need to enter in the URL field.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p><b>Language</p>
			<p></p>
			<p></B>If you wish to create a report in different languages then this option will 
				do it for you... you can choose between 
				English/German/Italian/French/Spanish/Danish/Japanese. If any of these require</p>
			<p>special characters like Japanese, then you need to select a default font and 
				Universal Alphabet in your browser. All these languages are defined in external 
				files in the lang/ folder of the application</p>
			<p>folder. All files are in text format and can be customized/modified to suite 
				your own needs.</p>
