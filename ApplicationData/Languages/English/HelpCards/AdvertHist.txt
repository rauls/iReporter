<!--OVERVIEW-->

This report helps to gauge the effectiveness over time of advertisements hosted on your web site. It first looks at the number of impressions, that is, the number of times visitors actually saw the advertisement on your site, and then goes on to report the number of times visitors followed the advertisement link. The act of following such a link is widely referred to as a "clickthrough". The number of impressions, versus the number of clickthroughs, gives you an immediate measure of advertising effectiveness on your site. 

If the number of impressions for an advertisement is below expectations, you may need to place it elsewhere on the page, or to redesign it completely. Similarly, a lower then expected number of clickthroughs may indicate a need to redesign or move the advertisement. It may also indicate a lack of interest in the topic being advertised.
