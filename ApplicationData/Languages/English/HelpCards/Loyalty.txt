# Report: Loyalty
# Please see Languages\English\Help Cards\Readme.txt for instructions.

<!--OVERVIEW-->
This report illustrates site loyalty via a measure of session numbers. Use this information to see how loyal your site visitors are, and to assess whether or not your site content makes visitors want to return. Low loyalty values generally indicate a lack of appropriate site content. Some web sites, however, are designed to be viewed once only, and hence, this report should be assessed in the  context of your site's expectations.
