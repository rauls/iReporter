# Report: Top Level Directories
# Please see Languages\English\Help Cards\Readme.txt for instructions.

<!--OVERVIEW-->
This report identifies the most popular top-level directories (folders) on your web server. Use this information to assess whether your most important content is receiving its expected share of traffic. If certain directories are considered to be more important than others, then these should have more hits against them. If this is not the case, you may need to restructure your site. The information presented will be most meaningful if your site content is properly grouped into different directories (e.g. /support, /products, /contact, etc). This report should be used instead of the "Directories" report when your top-level directories contain many sub-directories which aren't important enough to be analyzed independently.

<!--GRAPH-->
