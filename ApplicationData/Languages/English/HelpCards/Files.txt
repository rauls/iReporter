# Report: URLs
# Please see Languages\English\Help Cards\Readme.txt for instructions.

<!--OVERVIEW-->
This report identifies the most accessed URLs (Universal Resource Locators, such as http://www.quest.com/funnel_web/) on your web site. Use this information to see if your most important files are receiving the appropriate number of hits. The information may be skewed if your site uses frames, since base frame pages tend to receive more hits than pages deeper within the actual frames. This report is most powerful when used in conjunction with filters, to include or exclude particular files, such as base frame pages or graphic files. If you are interested in the most accessed pages, rather than full URLs, see the Pages report.
