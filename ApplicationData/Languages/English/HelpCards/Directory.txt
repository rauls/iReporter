# Report: Directories
# Please see Languages\English\Help Cards\Readme.txt for instructions.

<!--OVERVIEW-->
This report identifies the most popular directories (folders) on your web server. Use this information to assess whether your most important content is receiving its expected share of traffic. If certain directories are considered to be more important than others, then these should have more hits against them. If this is not the case, you may need to restructure your site. The information presented will be most meaningful if your site content is properly grouped into different directories (e.g. /support, /products, /contact, etc).
