<!--OVERVIEW-->
This report shows the web browsers (and their version number) being used by site visitors to make hits to your site, along with the operating system they are running on. By knowing the most popular browser types, you can determine the feasibility and appropriateness of using browser-specific features in your web content, such as frames, javascript or cascading style sheets. 

Additionally, there may be operating system-specific issues that need to be taken into consideration. Furthermore, different operating systems tend to represent different types of visitors, which should be taken into consideration when planning future site content.
