<!--OVERVIEW-->
This report shows the pages on which visitors exited your site over time. Use this information to gauge whether your site is consistently providing users with the content they're seeking. If your home page features prominently in this report, it suggests that visitors are either disinterested or cannot find the information they were looking for. Furthermore, if users are leaving your site before they can view more important information, it may indicate a need to review the site's structure, or to improve the content on earlier pages.
