<!--OVERVIEW-->
This report shows the most popular countries in which your site visitors are located.

Knowing where large groups of visitors originate may help to tailor your site content and/or structure to better serve these majorities.  If visitors from particular countries are of interest to your organization, yet only represent a small amount of overall traffic, it may highlight a need to more effectively advertise and promote your site to these countries.

Note: All machines on the Internet have a unique IP address (192.77.210.55) associated with them.  Several machines also have named addresses (www.quest.com) against their IP addresses for ease of use.  Many machines do NOT have a name associated with them, and these display as [UNRESOLVED IP] in this report.

If the only entry in this report is [UNRESOLVED IP], then you need to enable DNS Lookups, in <i>Settings > Analysis > Network > DNS</i>.
