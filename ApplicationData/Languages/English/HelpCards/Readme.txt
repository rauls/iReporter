Help Card Usage Instructions


< NOTES >

FWA Help Cards are fully editable, however:

- You *must* retain the 3 main sections: OVERVIEW, GRAPH, TABLE.
- All text above the OVERVIEW section will be ignored.


< FORMATTING OPTIONS >

The following HTML-type formatting options may be used:

- <B>	Bold
- <I>	Italic
- <U>	Underline
- <BR> 	Line return

Text using the <B>, <I> or <U> tags should be closed with </B>, </I> or </U> respectively.

E.g.  "The <B>Mean Path</B> Report shows the most popular..."


< SECTION INFORMATION >

- The <!--OVERVIEW--> section describes the report in context, and identifies 
how it may be used to improve site structure and/or performance.

- The <!--GRAPH--> section explains graph axis information.

- The <!--TABLE--> section details report table headers for greater understanding of the report.
