<!--OVERVIEW-->
This report shows the pages on which visitors entered your site over time. Use this information to gauge whether your intended entry pages are consistently fulfilling their role. If not, you may need to restructure your site. You can also find out if certain pages are being bookmarked (i.e. they can't normally be accessed other than through your main pages), which may indicate particular topics of interest that you need to propagate elsewhere in the site, or that should be moved to your intended entry pages.
