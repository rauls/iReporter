# Report: Pages Containing Broken Links
# Please see Languages\English\Help Cards\Readme.txt for instructions.


<!--OVERVIEW-->
This report shows all pages which contain broken links to your site.  Broken links point to pages that do not exist on your site, due to structural changes, retiring of old web content, or an incorrect/misspelt hyperlink.  Use this report to verify the integrity of your links, both external and internal.  Entering your main site URL (in Settings > Analysis > Options > URL > Default host), will yield both "External" and "Internal" versions of this report, which can be more efficiently used for locating external sites with bad links, as well as any local errors.
