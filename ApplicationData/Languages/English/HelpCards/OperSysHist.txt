<!--OVERVIEW-->
This report shows the operating systems (and version number, where applicable) being used by site visitors to make hits to your site over time. Use this information to ensure that your site content is viewable by visitors on all operating systems. Additionally, different operating systems tend to represent different types of visitors, so any upward and downward trends in a particular operating system should be taken into consideration when planning future site content.
