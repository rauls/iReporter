# Report: Domains
# Please see Languages\English\Help Cards\Readme.txt for instructions.

<!--OVERVIEW-->
This report identifies the key domain names visiting your site, based on their
second-level domain suffixes (such as aol.com, uu.net, etc).  

Knowing where large groups of visitors originate may help to tailor your site content and/or structure to better serve these majorities.  If visitors from particular domains are of interest to your organization, yet only represent a small amount of overall traffic, it may highlight a need to more effectively advertize and promote your site to these domains.

Note: All machines on the Internet have a unique IP address (192.168.10.12) associated with them.  Several machines also have named addresses (www.quest.com) against their IP addresses for ease of use.  Many machines do NOT have a name associated with them, and these display as [UNRESOLVED IP] in this report.

If the only entry in this report is [UNRESOLVED IP], then you need to switch on DNS Lookups, in <i>Settings > Analysis > Network > DNS</i>.

<!--GRAPH-->
