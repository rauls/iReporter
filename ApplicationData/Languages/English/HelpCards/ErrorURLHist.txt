<!--OVERVIEW-->
This report identifies the files which are causing the most errors on your site over time. Use this information to identify error trends, and to gauge the success of any efforts to eradicate the files causing errors. Errors that are not corrected for a long time will heavily compromise your site's usability and reputation. The source of these errors can be found in the internal and external "Pages Containing Broken Links" reports.
