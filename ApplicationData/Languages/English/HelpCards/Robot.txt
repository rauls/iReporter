<!--OVERVIEW-->
This report shows the activity of search engine robots (also known as spiders or crawlers) that
traversed your site. While on your site, a robot looks for META keywords embedded within your HTML files. This is how your site will be found when Internet users query search engines for particular keywords. Check the Search Engines report to see if your keywords are as effective as you expect. If not, you may need to alter them. This report should be reviewed if any changes to keywords occur, to make sure search engine robots have returned to update your site details.
