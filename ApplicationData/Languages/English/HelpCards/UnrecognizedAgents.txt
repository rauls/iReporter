# Report: Unrecognized Agents
# Please see Languages\English\Help Cards\Readme.txt for instructions.

<!--OVERVIEW-->
This report shows all the unrecognized agents in your log file. An "agent" essentially refers to the program being used to make hits to your web site. Examples of agents are Microsoft's Internet Explorer and Google's Googlebot. If you're seeing this report, your log file will contain an "agent" field, containing data that identifies the program being used to access your site. These agents are decoded by iReporter  into web browsers and search engine robots, according to entries specified in the <i>Settings</i> file. Where FWA cannot find a suitable match from the <i>Settings</i> file, it will place them in this report. Refer to the <i>Settings</i> for instructions on how to add new browsers and robots.
